✅ Good: "Add Claude AI service with message completion and streaming"
❌ Vague: "Add AI stuff"

### **Provide Context**
✅ Good: "In the Writing Engine, add a method to generate dialogue using Claude"
❌ Less helpful: "Add dialogue generation"

### **Ask Follow-ups**
✅ Good: "Can you also add error handling and retry logic?"
❌ Less helpful: (no follow-up)

### **Review Changes**
✅ Good: "Show me what changed before committing"
❌ Less helpful: (no review)
