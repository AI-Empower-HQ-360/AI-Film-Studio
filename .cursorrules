2. **Default working directory:** `C:\Users\ctrpr\Projects\AI-Film-Studio` (or `./` when workspace is AI Film Studio).
3. **Run terminal commands** from the AI Film Studio root unless explicitly told otherwise (e.g. `cd frontend`, `cd infrastructure/aws-cdk`).
4. **Search and edit** only within AI Film Studio. Do not touch files in youtube-video-summar or other projects unless the user explicitly asks.
5. **Reference architecture:** 8-engine system (Character, Writing, Pre-Production, Production Management, Production Layer, Post-Production, Marketing, Enterprise Platform). See `docs/INVESTOR_DEVELOPER_MASTER_BLUEPRINT.md`.
