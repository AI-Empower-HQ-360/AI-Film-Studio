## Title: "The Last Frame"

### Scene 1: INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A cozy coffee shop with warm lighting. Rain patters against the windows. 

EMMA (28), a photographer, sits alone at a corner table, reviewing photos on her laptop. She has tired eyes but a determined expression.

**EMMA**
(muttering to herself)
One more shot. Just one perfect shot.

She scrolls through hundreds of similar photos, dissatisfied with each.

### Scene 2: EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

Emma walks through the rain-soaked streets, camera in hand. She looks up at the overcast sky, then at the reflections in puddles.

She raises her camera but doesn't take a shot.

**EMMA**
(sighs)
Not quite right.

### Scene 3: INT. EMMA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A small studio apartment filled with photography equipment and prints on the walls. Emma sits on the floor, surrounded by photo albums.

She opens an old album and finds a photo of herself as a child with her father, both holding cameras and smiling.

**EMMA**
(softly)
"The perfect shot is the one that makes you feel something."

She closes the album and grabs her camera with new determination.

### Scene 4: EXT. CITY PARK - DAWN

Emma arrives at the park as the sun begins to rise. Morning mist hangs in the air. She walks quietly through the empty paths.

She stops suddenly. A single dandelion seed floats through a beam of golden sunlight.

Emma raises her camera and takes the shot.

**EMMA**
(smiling)
Perfect.

FADE TO BLACK.
