## 🎯 Overview

**AI Film Studio** is a cloud-native platform that transforms text scripts into cinematic short films (30-90 seconds) using AI-powered image/video generation and intelligent composition.

### **Key Features**

✅ **End-to-End Automation** — Script → Scene Graph → Shot Generation → Video Composition  
✅ **Story & Cultural Context-Aware** — Dynamic image generation based on script narrative and cultural settings  
✅ **Scalable Cloud Architecture** — AWS-based infrastructure supporting 10,000+ users  
✅ **GPU-Accelerated AI** — SDXL, custom models for high-quality visual generation  
✅ **DevOps Best Practices** — IaC, CI/CD, multi-environment deployments  
✅ **Production-Ready** — Monitoring, alerting, auto-scaling, security hardening  

### **Image Generation Workflow**

The platform implements a sophisticated, **script-driven image generation pipeline** that adapts to:
- 📜 **Story narrative and context** — Characters, scenes, and props generated based on script
- 🌍 **Cultural authenticity** — Traditional attire, architecture, and customs (South Indian, Western, East Asian, etc.)
- 🎭 **Dynamic character adaptation** — Same characters generate different visuals based on story context
- 🎨 **Scene consistency** — Backgrounds, lighting, and atmosphere match the narrative

**Dependency Hierarchy:** Script → Cultural Detection → Character Images → Scene Backgrounds → Video Synthesis

📖 **[View Detailed Image Generation Workflow →](./docs/architecture/image-generation-workflow.md)**

### **Target Users**


- Content creators and marketers
- Indie filmmakers and studios
- Educational institutions
- Corporate training departments

## 🌍 Environments

| Environment | Branch | Purpose | Infrastructure |
|-------------|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Dev** | `dev` | Rapid development and testing | Small instances, single AZ |
| **Sandbox** | `sandbox` | Integration and QA testing | Mirrors prod, scaled down |
| **Staging** | `staging` | Pre-production validation | Prod-like, blue-green ready |
| **Production** | `main` | Live user traffic | Multi-AZ, auto-scaling, HA |

### Branch Strategy

This project follows a multi-environment branch strategy for safe CI/CD deployments:

- **`dev`** → Development environment (automatic deployment)
- **`sandbox`** → Testing/QA environment (automatic deployment, QA approval required)
- **`staging`** → Pre-production environment (manual deployment with approval)
- **`main`** → Production environment (manual deployment with multiple approvals)

📂 See: [`docs/BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md`](./docs/BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md) for complete workflow details.

## 🤖 Automation & Tooling

This project leverages various automation tools to streamline development and maintain code quality:

### **GitHub Actions**

GitHub Actions workflows are set up for continuous integration and deployment:

- **Deployment Pipeline**: Automatically builds and deploys the Next.js frontend to GitHub Pages on push to `main`
- **CI/CD Workflows**: Additional workflows can be configured for backend testing, worker validation, and infrastructure deployment

To add new workflows:
1. Create a `.yml` file in `.github/workflows/`
2. Define triggers, jobs, and steps following [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

### **Recommended Bots & Automation**

Consider setting up these automated tools to enhance your workflow:

| Bot/Tool | Purpose | Setup |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **Dependabot** | Automated dependency updates | Add `dependabot.yml` to `.github/` |
| **CodeQL** | Security vulnerability scanning | Enable in repository security settings |
| **Stale Bot** | Auto-close inactive issues/PRs | Add `stale.yml` workflow |
| **Semantic Release** | Automated versioning and changelog | Configure in CI pipeline |
| **Pre-commit Hooks** | Code quality checks before commits | Add `.pre-commit-config.yaml` |
| **Branch Protection** | Require reviews and status checks | Configure in repository settings |

### **Setting Up Dependabot**

To enable automated dependency updates, create `.github/dependabot.yml`:

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/frontend"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
```
